# AdvPrint Pro — Print from Any Web Page to Any Printer

**Silent. Local. Open source. No subscription.**

AdvPrint Pro prints from any web page to **any printer** — thermal, receipt, label, or standard — with **no print dialog and no confirmation**. It is a free, 100%-local, MIT-licensed alternative to paid products like Ultraprint Hub: a small **desktop hub** (single Python file, zero pip dependencies) plus a **Chrome extension** that talk to each other on `localhost` only.

```
Web page ──► Chrome extension ──► AdvPrint Pro hub (localhost:9235) ──► ANY printer
             (right-click /       • queue: pause · resume · cancel      thermal · receipt
              popup / API /       • history: last 100 jobs (SQLite)     label · A4 · POS
              auto rules)         • screenshot & HTML → PDF              80mm roll
```

## What's new in v2.5.0 (the merge release — git-repo parity)

- **Package = your git repo, 1:1.** The zip now unpacks to the exact tree of `github.com/bitdreamit/PrintHub-Pro`: `tool/` (windows portable hub + service + runtime, unix hub), `extension/` (incl. `i18n.js` Bangla strings restored), `docs/`, `tests/` + `pytest.ini` + `.gitignore` at the root. Extract `full.zip` over your repo working copy and `git status` shows only real changes — no renames, no deletions. (`doc/` in the repo is an old duplicate of `docs/` — `git rm -r doc` once.)
- **Honest fix: v2.4.0/2.4.1 were rebuilt from an older 1.5.0 tree after a dev-machine reset and accidentally dropped v2.0–v2.3 features.** v2.5.0 merges the REAL 2.3.0 source (recovered from this git repo) with the 2.4.x fixes, so **everything is back**: LAN sharing (`share_lan`, `/peers`, peer forwarding), the full **ESC/POS + ZPL raw printing** suite with Bangla auto-routing via headless Chrome, **scheduled prints** (`run_at`), printer groups + profiles, priority queue, dedupe, exponential retry.
- **SumatraPDF detection made service-proof** — per-user `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SumatraPDF` (dynamic user name), both Program Files, **registry (HKCU+HKLM, 32/64 views)**, `PATH`, portable folder scan, and a new **all-users profile scan** (`C:\Users\*`) so it is found even when the hub runs as a Windows **service** under a different account. Fresh re-scan on every job + `sumatra_path` manual override (dashboard Settings → Save).
- **Virtual PDF printers save directly** to `Downloads\AdvPrint` (status `saved`, no Save-As dialog) — printing to *Microsoft Print to PDF* works with **no physical printer** and no SumatraPDF.
- **Dashboard live test tool** (kept from 2.4.x, now inside the 2.3.0 dashboard): *"Send test print & watch live"* with the verdict **REAL PRINTER HIT / SAVED / HELD / FAILED+reason**, *Release ALL held jobs*, and a Settings box for `sumatra_path`.
- `/client/report` alias for `POST /debug/report` (extension browser-error reporting), `POST /jobs/{id}/release` + `POST /jobs/release_all` (dashboard/extension friendly names for print-now).
- **Tests**: 78 pytest (your repo suite, layout-fixed) + 64-check smoke — all green on the merged hub.

## What's new in v2.4.1 (packaging & docs release)

- **Frozen folder format** — the folder layout changed too often between releases (v1.x zips were loose, v2.0–v2.4.0 put the version in the root folder name, so every update "moved everything"). From v2.4.1 every zip unpacks to **`AdvPrintPro/`** — no version in the name. Extract over the old folder, reload the extension, done — **the layout never changes again**. Full explanation + per-folder reference: `docs/FOLDER-MAP.md`.
- **`docs/EXTENSION-TEST.md`** — the missing test guide: a 5-minute, step-by-step extension tool test that ends with the proof the **real printer was hit** (live dashboard verdict + where the physical proof shows up: paper, Windows print queue, or the PDF in `Downloads\AdvPrint`), plus a symptom → where-to-look → fix table.
- Version strings synced everywhere (hub, extension, installers, installers' metadata) — `popup` and `options` all report **2.4.1**.

## What's new in v2.4.0 (debug & reliability release)

- **LIVE debug & test tool** — open `http://127.0.0.1:9235/dashboard?token=<your token>` in any browser: send a real test print and **watch every step live** (queued → printing → printed / saved / held / failed) with a final verdict: *REAL PRINTER HIT* or the exact reason why not. Includes Release-held-jobs ("Print now"), settings toggles and one-click `/debug` + `/audit` views.
- **`GET /debug`** — one JSON page that answers *"why is it not printing?"*: hub version/uptime, worker alive, queue + held counts, every printer with ready/offline status, SumatraPDF found + **the exact list of paths searched**, recent jobs with errors, 7-day success rate, and a prioritized `problems[]` list with fixes. Token required (`?token=`).
- **`GET /audit`** — persistent audit trail (SQLite): `print.submitted` (with SHA-256 doc hash), `print.held`, `print.requeued`, `print.saved`, `auth.failed` (wrong token, per-attempt), `config.changed`, `queue.paused/resumed`.
- **SumatraPDF detection rebuilt** — the user name is **never hardcoded**: per-user install (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\SumatraPDF\SumatraPDF.exe` — resolves to the CURRENT user, e.g. `C:\Users\<name>\...`), both Program Files, Windows **registry** (App Paths + Uninstall, per-user and per-machine), `PATH`, folder scan, plus a manual **`sumatra_path` override** in Settings. Detection re-runs **fresh on every job** — installing SumatraPDF takes effect on the next print, **no hub restart needed**. Failed jobs auto-retry 2× (60 s apart).
- **Instant / direct print mode** — `POST /print` with `"instant": true` (or extension toggle / `mode:"instant"`) jumps the queue and prints immediately. If no printer is ready, the job **auto-falls back to the normal queue** (`instant_auto_queue`) — nothing is ever lost.
- **Hold-while-offline done right** — jobs for an offline printer are parked as `held` (with reason), auto-released by a watcher every 5 s when the printer comes back, and can be force-printed any time ("Print now" / `POST /jobs/{id}/release` / `POST /jobs/release_all`).
- **Virtual PDF printers solved** — printing to *Microsoft Print to PDF* would pop a Save-As dialog; the hub now **saves the PDF directly** to your Downloads/AdvPrint folder (status `saved`, path shown in dashboard & `/debug`). Works even with **no physical printer installed**.
- **Debug on/off switch** — in the dashboard Settings AND extension options. When on, the **extension reports browser-side JS errors** to the hub (`POST /client/report`) and `/debug` shows them next to the desktop-side errors — you can see whether the problem is in the web side or the desktop side. Every toggle is audit-logged (`config.changed: debug`).
- **`POST /config` / `GET /config`** — live-editable settings persisted to `<data>/config.json`: `debug`, `hold_offline`, `instant_auto_queue`, `sumatra_path`, `file_dir`, `printer`, `token_header_only`.

## Feature highlights

| | AdvPrint Pro |
|---|---|
| **Any printer** | Thermal, receipt, label, or standard. If the OS sees it, the hub can print to it. |
| **Save as PDF (File)** | Any job can go to a **File** destination instead of paper — the hub writes the PDF into `~/Downloads/AdvPrint` (configurable). No dialog, no paper. |
| **No print dialog** | Jobs are sent straight to the OS print system (SumatraPDF on Windows, CUPS `lp` on Linux/macOS). |
| **Auto-routing rules** | Match URLs to printers automatically — orders page → receipt printer, shipping page → label printer. |
| **Auto-print on open** | Open a report URL (e.g. your Laravel `/medical_reports/pdf-test/...` route) and it prints instantly — the tab closes right after, so there is **zero browser view**. |
| **Print interception** | `window.print()` calls **and Ctrl+P / Cmd+P** from any web app (Odoo, SAP, POS) are rerouted silently. Injection is CSP-safe: it works even on strict-CSP sites with no console errors. |
| **Works everywhere** | Any web application: ERP, POS, e-commerce, logistics, healthcare. |
| **Developer API** | Global one-liner `printPdfLink(url, title)` on every page (silent + automatic browser fallback) + `window.advprint` API + plain HTTP `POST /print` (raw binary PDF = no base64) for any language. |
| **Screenshot printing** | Capture and print the visible page with one click. |
| **Print queue** | Pause, resume, cancel — live, and the queue survives hub restarts. |
| **Job history** | Last 100 jobs with status, printer, timing — reprint any job in one click. |
| **Enterprise ready** | Managed-storage schema (`managed.json`) for GPO/MDM deployment of settings and locked rules. |
| **Private by design** | No data collection, no external servers, no accounts. Hub binds to `127.0.0.1` and is token-protected. |

**Extra features beyond the paid original:** auto-print PDF URLs with login cookies (Laravel signed routes work), silent printing of raw text to 80 mm thermal rolls, **save-as-PDF File destination for every job type**, reprint-from-history via HTTP and CLI, `doctor` self-diagnosis, optional LAN mode for shared office printers.

## Quick start (3 steps)

### 1. Install the hub (one-time, zero questions)

**Easiest — native installers (v2.4.1):**

| | file | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | `AdvPrint-Pro-Setup-2.4.1.exe` | **STANDALONE installer — Python is included inside** (bundled 3.11 runtime + `AdvPrintPro.exe`): copies everything to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\AdvPrintPro`, registers **auto-run as a visible Startup app** (Task Manager → Startup apps → "AdvPrint Pro"), starts the hub, adds Start Menu shortcuts + a real **Add/Remove Programs uninstaller**. The hub shows a **"AdvPrint Pro" tray icon** (right-click = status page, test page, pause, auto-run on/off, exit). No admin, no Python install, no dialogs, never shows as "python". Note: unsigned EXE → SmartScreen may ask once: *More info → Run anyway*. |
| **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint)** | `advprint-pro_2.4.1_all.deb` | `sudo apt install ./advprint-pro_2.4.1_all.deb` — installs to `/opt/advprint`, ships a **systemd user service** (auto-run at login, restarts on crash) + XDG autostart fallback. CLI: `advprint doctor`. |
| **macOS / other Linux** | `tool/unix/install-unix.sh` | same auto-run via LaunchAgent / systemd --user / XDG, no sudo needed. |

**Or the portable way (both platforms):**

**Windows** — double-click one file:
```
tool\windows\portable\install\install-windows.bat        ← starts the hub NOW + auto-run at every logon,
                                     uses the BUNDLED Python runtime (installer\runtime)
                                     if present - no system Python needed, no prompts
```

**Linux / macOS** — one command:
```
bash tool/unix/install-unix.sh       ← starts the hub NOW + auto-run at every login,
                                     no sudo needed (systemd --user / LaunchAgent)
```

Both installers register **auto-run automatically** — after a reboot the hub is
always there, no shortcut needed. To undo it:

| | stop auto-run + hub | keep / remove print data |
|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | `tool\windows\portable\install\UNINSTALL-WINDOWS.bat` | data in `%USERPROFILE%\.advprint` |
| **Linux / macOS** | `bash tool/unix/uninstall-unix.sh` | data in `~/.advprint` |

Windows notes (v2.4.1): the hub runs as `AdvPrintPro.exe` (a renamed
`pythonw.exe`), so Task Manager shows **"AdvPrintPro"** — not "python".
Auto-run is a normal **Startup app** shortcut: open **Task Manager →
Startup apps** and you will find "AdvPrint Pro" there with its icon —
right-click → Enable/Disable any time (same switch as the tray icon
menu, or `UNINSTALL-WINDOWS.bat`). The installer also removes
Mark-of-the-Web from the downloaded files automatically, and the
installer/upgrader deletes the invisible scheduled task that v1.2–v1.4
used to create. If the hub ever fails to start after a reboot, open
`%USERPROFILE%\.advprint\hub.log` — the hub logs every
startup and print there.

The hub starts on `http://127.0.0.1:9235`. Fresh installs generate a private
random token (read it with `python "C:\\...\\hub\\advprint.py" token` — use the full path, or the desktop tool); upgrades of pre-2.0
installs keep working with the old default `PrintHub-2024` until you rotate it.
Wrong-token bookmarks are fixed in one click on the dashboard error page itself.

### 2. Load the extension

1. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome / Edge / Brave
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right)
3. Click **Load unpacked** → select the `extension/` folder

### 3. Connect & print

1. Click the AdvPrint icon → the popup shows **Connected**
2. Right-click any page → **AdvPrint Pro → Print this page**
3. Or open a URL matching a routing rule (the default rule auto-prints `*://www.htncr.org/lab/medical_reports/*`) — it prints with no dialog

## The HTTP API (any language, any tool)

```bash
# list printers
curl -H "X-AdvPrint-Token: $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:9235/printers

# print a PDF from a URL (silent)
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9235/print \
  -H "X-AdvPrint-Token: $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"pdf_url":"https://example.com/invoice.pdf","title":"Invoice 42"}'

# print a thermal receipt
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:9235/print \
  -H "X-AdvPrint-Token: $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"|center|MY SHOP\nItem 1      10.00\nTOTAL        10.00","paper":"thermal"}'

# pause / resume / clear the queue
curl -X POST -H "X-AdvPrint-Token: $TOKEN" http://127.0.0.1:9235/queue/pause
```

## Configuration

| Environment variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ADVPRINT_TOKEN` | (random per install) | API token (header `X-AdvPrint-Token`; legacy `PRINTHUB_TOKEN` still honored) |
| `ADVPRINT_PORT` | `9235` | HTTP port |
| `ADVPRINT_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address — set `0.0.0.0` for office LAN sharing |
| `ADVPRINT_PRINTER` | *(OS default)* | Force a specific printer |
| `ADVPRINT_FILE_DIR` | `~/Downloads/AdvPrint` | Where `destination:"file"` PDFs are saved |
| `ADVPRINT_DATA` | `~/.advprint` | Data folder (SQLite history + job files) |

**CLI:** `python hub/advprint.py serve | testprint [a4|thermal] | printers | history [n] | reprint <id> | queue | doctor | help`

**LAN mode:** set `ADVPRINT_HOST=0.0.0.0` and point the extension (Options → Hub URL) at your PC's LAN IP, e.g. `http://192.168.1.20:9235`. Token is always required.

---

## Privacy & security

- **No data collection.** There is no telemetry, no account, no analytics.
- **Localhost only.** The hub binds to `127.0.0.1` unless you explicitly enable LAN mode.
- **Token-protected.** Every endpoint (except `/health`) requires the token, compared in constant time.
- **Open source, MIT.** Audit every line — the whole hub is one readable Python file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (no pip packages)
- **Windows:** [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/) (free, installer offers it via winget)
- **Linux/macOS:** CUPS (`cups-client`)
- Optional: Chrome/Chromium/Edge — used only for *page* printing (HTML → PDF); PDF/image/text printing works without it
